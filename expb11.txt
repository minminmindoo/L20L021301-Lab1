Biodiversity, the variety of life on Earth, plays a critical role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems.
It encompasses the diversity of species, genetic variations, and ecosystems themselves, providing a rich
tapestry of life that supports human existence. Healthy ecosystems purify air and water, mitigate floods,
and support pollination, which is essential for food production.
