Moreover, biodiversity contributes to cultural and economic well-being. Many communities around the world
rely on natural resources for their livelihoods, including agriculture, fishing, and tourism. Diverse ecosystems
offer a wealth of resources, from medicinal plants to raw materials, which are indispensable for various
industries. Additionally, nature and wildlife hold intrinsic value, enriching human experiences and inspiring
art, science, and recreation. Protecting biodiversity is thus not only an environmental imperative but also a
socio-economic necessity, ensuring that future generations can enjoy and benefit from the planet's natural
heritage.
