Healthy ecosystems purify air and water, mitigate floods, and support pollination, which is essential for food production. The interdependence of species ensures
that ecosystems are resilient and can adapt to changes, thereby sustaining life on the planet. The loss of
biodiversity can disrupt these natural processes, leading to dire consequences for both the environment and
human societies.v
